# ESP32 BLE Sensor Server

This project aims to create a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor server using the ESP32 microcontroller. The server will read data from various sensors, such as tank level sensors, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, etc., and send this data to a client over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. The client in mind when this project was created is a Raspberry Pi running Venus OS, but it can be used with any compatible consumer. 

The main features of this project include:
- Reading data from various sensors
- Sending sensor data to a client over BLE communication
- Compatibility with Raspberry Pi running Venus OS
